          Welcome to my little digital space on the internet! My name is Justin
          and I'm a Software Engineer on an unwavering journey to master the
          craft of programming.

        <br />
        <p className={styles.desc}>
          In my development journey, I'm not just focused on building
          applications; I'm dedicated to embodying the philosophy of
          Kaizenâ€”Continuous Improvement. It's the guiding principle behind
          everything I create, including my latest project, LifeQuest. This app
          is a manifestation of my belief in celebrating every small step
          towards mastery. Picture this: becoming 1% better each day, and
          LifeQuest transforms that philosophy into a tangible reality. Whether
          it's hitting the gym, coding, cooking, reading, or mastering a skill,
          watch your progress visually unfold, day by day I choose to live
          improve and move forward!
